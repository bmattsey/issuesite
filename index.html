    <h2>Who We Are:</h2>
  <p>We at the Next Step Initiative Believe in a world where everyone in America has the ability to reach a higher level of education. In the United States 11.5% of is living at or below the poverty line. Because of this, many Illinoisians don't have access to things such as a higher education, which would allow them to strive for better livelihoods. This is exactly what the Next Step Initiative Seeks to resolve. By providing resources and spreading awareness, we are bridging the gap to higher education. We at the Next Step Initiative believe that your life should not be limited by the experiences you come from and that evryone should have the ability to strive for more in life. </p>
